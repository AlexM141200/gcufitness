            <h1>Confused About Sets and Reps?</h1>
            <h2>Reps</h2>
            <p>A repetition, or “rep”, is one complete movement of the specified exercise.
                For example, if the exercise is bicep curls, one rep would be one completed bicep curl.
                Each rep should start at the beginning portion of the movement, and end at the finished portion.
                Each rep should look the same, being performed slowly and controlling the weight for the entire portion of the exercise.
            </p>
            <h2>Sets</h2>
            <p>A set is a group of consecutive repetitions. For example, performing 10 bicep curls in a row would be one completed set.
                For the workout plans, you are expected to perform two/three warm-up sets, to prime the muscle and get ready. The purpose of these is to increase blood flow to the desired muscle, while not causing any fatigue.
                Working sets are where the muscle is built. These sets should be slow and controlled, with higher effort than the warmup sets. When finishing a working set, you should not be able to do any more repetitions while keeping good technique.</p>
            <h2>Rest</h2>
            <p>Between warmup sets, a rest time of 90 seconds is ideal. Between the last warmup set and first working set, between 90 seconds to three minutes should be taken. A similar rest period should be taken between the first two working sets.</p>
